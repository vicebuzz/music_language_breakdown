# Project to identify language of songs in my library and present a language breakdown

## Plan
- Scrape songs from apple music
- Train an NLP model to identify a language of each of the songs
- Dump everything in CSV file or RDBMS
- Go through records, correcting mistakes
- Create visualisation panels (perhaps only one)

## Resources used
